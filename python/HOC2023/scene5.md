## Step 1
# Agent Training

The time agents have now mastered all the important principles! The final step is to position them correctly so they can teach the main AI everything they've learned!

The four functions you'll use to move the time agents are:
- `match_blue_agent()`
![Blue Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/blue_agent.png "Blue Agent")
- `match_green_agent()`
![Green Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/green_agent.png "Green Agent")
- `match_yellow_agent()`
![Yellow Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/yellow_agent.png "Yellow Agent")
- `match_red_agent()`
![Red Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/red_agent.png "Red Agent")

Each of those functions take a single parameter that represents their destination.

Valid destinations are: 
- `1` ![Fairness_Inclusiveness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/fairness_inclusiveness.png "Fairness and Inclusiveness")
- `2` ![Reliability_Safety](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/reliability_safety.png "Reliability and Safety")
- `3` ![Transparence_Accountability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/transparency_accountabilty.png "Transparency and Accountability")
- `4` ![Privacy_Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2023/img/privacy_security.png "Privacy and Security")

## Step 2
# Activity:

Match the Agents with the training locations that contain the principle they represent.

```python
# code here

match_blue_agent(1)
match_green_agent(2)
match_yellow_agent(3)
match_red_agent(4)
```
