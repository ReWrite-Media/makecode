# Pillar2

## Step 1
# Yellow Pillar

Use code to cross the void and reach the Yellow Pillar. You have access to two functions. `agent_move()` and `agent_place()`

The `agent_move()` function takes one parameter which is a string. It defines what direction the agent should move in.

Valid directions are: 
- `forward`
- `back`
- `up`
- `down`

The `agent_place()` function takes one parameter which is a string. It defines what direction the agent should move in.

Valid directions are: 
- `up`
- `down`

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

agent_move("forward")
agent_place("down")
agent_move("forward")
agent_place("down")
agent_move("forward")
agent_place("down")
```

## Step 2
# Activity:

Build a bridge to reach the yellow pillar. The pillar is 8 blocks away.

```python
# code here

agent_move("forward")
agent_place("down")
agent_move("forward")
agent_place("down")
agent_move("forward")
agent_place("down")
```
