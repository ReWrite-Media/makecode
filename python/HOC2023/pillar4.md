Now that the trapdoor is open, you'll need to move the Agent up two blocks to set it free. Use the `agent.move()` function to move the Agent up.

The `agent.move()` function takes one parameter that defines what direction it should move in.

Valid directions are: 
- `forward`
- `back`
- `left`
- `right`
- `up`
- `down`

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# make the agent move up one block

agent.move("up")
```

## Step 2
# Activity:

Help the Agent out of the floor. Move it up two blocks to get it out.

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

agent.move("up")
```
