## Step 1
# Bird Trouble

We can't fully understand the code because some parts of it are unclear and hidden. But before we can solve this puzzle, we need to figure out the meaning of those hidden words. Let's track the birds in the code to see if we can uncover what this code is all about.

There is no need to change this code.

## New Functions:

`fly_to_0110101011()` We won't know what this function does until we could decode all the obfuscated words.

`a_1001010_101101()` We won't know what this function does until we could decode all the obfuscated words.

```python
while search_for_101101():
    if a_101101 == True:
        pickup_101101()
        move_101101()
    continue_flight_loop()
```
