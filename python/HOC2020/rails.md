## Step 1
# Connect the towns
The Illagers feel like the Villagers don't like them because very few ever come to their fair. The reason few Villagers go is because itâ€™s too difficult to get up the hill between the two towns. Use `agent.give()` to give the Agent a minecart `rail` and `agent.place()` to create a minecart railway between the two towns.

The `agent.give()` function takes three parameters.  

- item (*string*): The item you want to give the Agent.
- count (*integer*): How many items the Agent will receive.
- slot (*integer*): The inventory slot where the Agent receives the item.

The `agent.place()` function takes two parameters.  

- direction (*string*): The direction you want the Agent to place the item.
    - Valid directions are: 
        - forward
        - back
        - left
        - right
        - up
        - down
- slot number (*integer*): Which inventory slot the Agent should use.

```python
# this will give the Agent two rails
# then place one down and move forward
agent.give("rail", 2, 1)
agent.place("down", 1)
agent.move("forward")
```

---

## Step 2
The `agent.move()` function takes one parameter, direction.

Valid directions are: 
- forward
- back
- left
- right
- up
- down

```python
# move the Agent forward one block.
agent.move("forward")
# move the Agent backward one block.
agent.move("back")
# move the Agent left one block.
agent.move("left")
# move the Agent right one block.
agent.move("right")
```

---

## Step 3
# Pro Tip:
Use a `for` loop to do a group of actions multiple times.

```python
# this will make the agent place
# a rail under it and then move forward.
# this will repeat four times.
for i in range(4):
    agent.give("rail", 2, 1)
    agent.place("down", 1)
    agent.move("forward")
```

## Step 4
# Activity:
Create a railway inside the tunnel between the two wood and stone posts.

**Note: You can reset the activity by speaking with the NPC or by using the Reset World button.**
