# Kitchen Feedhouse

## Step 1
# Feed the House

The house is hungry! And what better to feed it than apples, salmon, and mushroom stew! See if you could figure out how many of each ingredient the house requires. Use the `feed_house()` function to define what items you want to feed it.

The `feed_house()` function takes one parameter that defines what item you're going to feed it.

Valid opptions are:
- `apple` ![Apple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2022/img/apple.png "Apple")
- `mushroom stew` ![Mushroom Stew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2022/img/mushroom_stew.png "Mushroom Strew")
- `salmon` ![Salmon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2022/img/salmon.png "Salmon")

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# feed the house 4 apples and
# 1 mushroom stew

feed_house("apple")
feed_house("apple")
feed_house("apple")
feed_house("apple")
feed_house("mushroom stew")
```

---

## Step 2
# Pro Tip:

Use a `for` loop to do one or more actions multiple times.

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# feed the house 4 apples and
# 1 mushroom stew

for i in range(4):
    feed_house("apple")

feed_house("mushroom stew")
```

## Step 3
# Activity:

Zombie Chefs are holding food while they ride by on platters! There seems to be a pattern here... I wonder if they are here to feed the house? Figure out how many of each food item the house wants, then write a program to feed the house the correct amount! 

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

feed_house("apple")
feed_house("apple")
feed_house("salmon")
```
