# Attic Red

## Step 1
# Attic Tutorial (Red Path)

To open the Red door, both you and the Agent will have to work together. Flip the lever to bring up the iron wall, then move the Agent so it is positioned above the gold blocks in front of the Red door. Use `agent.move()` function to move the agent on the gold blocks. 

The `agent.move()` function takes one parameter that defines what direction it should move in.

Valid directions are: 
- `forward`
- `back`
- `left`
- `right`
- `up`
- `down`

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the agent 5 blocks forward

agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
```

---

## Step 2
# Pro Tip:

Use a `for` loop to do one or more actions multiple times.

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the agent 5 blocks forward

for i in range(5):
    agent.move("forward")
```

## Step 3
# Activity:

To open the Red door, flip the lever to bring up the iron wall, then move the Agent so it is positioned above the gold blocks in front of the red door. 

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
agent.move("forward")
```
