# Potion Mixing

## Step 1
# Potion Mixing

It looks like you can make something here! Maybe there is a potion recipe somewhere in this room that can help? Locate a recipe, then use the `summon_item()` function to summon the ingredients in the correct order to complete the potion! 

The `summon_item()` function takes one parameter to define which item it should summon.

Valid items are:
- `netherwart` ![Netherwart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2022/img/netherwart.png "Netherwart")
- `fermented spider eye` ![Fermented Spider Eye](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2022/img/fermented_spider_eye.png "Fermented Spider Eye")
- `phantom membrane` ![Phantom Membrane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReWrite-Media/makecode/master/python/HOC2022/img/phantom_membrane.png "Phantom Membrane")

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# summon one netherwart

summon_item("netherwart")
```

## Step 2
# Activity:

Search the room to find the potion recipe, and then summon the ingredients in the correct order to drop them into the cauldrons to make a potion! 

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

summon_item("netherwart")
summon_item("phantom membrane")
```
