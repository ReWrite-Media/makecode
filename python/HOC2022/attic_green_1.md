# Attic Green 1

## Step 1
# Attic Tutorial (Green Path Part 1)

The box with the arrow on the floor is your cursor. You'll use the cursor to manipulate blocks to solve puzzles throughout this experience. In this activity you'll use it to open the trapdoor and release the Agent. Use `move_cursor()` to position the cursor and `open_trapdoor()` to open the trapdoor you have selected.

The `move_cursor()` function takes one parameter that defines its direction. That parameter is the color of the arrow that represents the direction you want to move.

Valid directions are:
- `orange` (moves the cursor forward) ![Orange Arrow](img/orange_arrow.png "Orange Arrow")

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the cursor forward 3 blocks
# open the trapdoor that's selected

move_cursor("orange")
move_cursor("orange")
open_trapdoor()
```

---

## Step 2
# Activity:

Move the cursor, so it is positioned above the wooden trapdoor in the middle of the Attic, then open the trapdoor to let out the Agent who is trapped underneath.

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

move_cursor("orange")
move_cursor("orange")
open_trapdoor()
```
