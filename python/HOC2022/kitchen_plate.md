# Kitchen Plate

## Step 1
# Plate Swap

The silly Zombie Chef gave everyone the wrong meals! See if you can figure out who wants what meal. Use the `swap_plates()` function to swap the plates on either side of the colored tablecloth you define.

The `swap_plates()` takes one parameter that defines the color of the tablecloth that's between the two plates you want to swap.

Valid colors are:
- `orange` ![Orange Arrow](img/orange_arrow.png "Orange Arrow")
- `blue` ![Blue Arrow](img/blue_arrow.png "Blue Arrow")
- `yellow` ![Yellow Arrow](img/yellow_arrow.png "Yellow Arrow")
- `magenta` ![Magenta Arrow](img/magenta_arrow.png "Magenta Arrow")

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# swap the plates on either side
# of the orange tablecloth and then
# do the same for the blue tablecloth

swap_plates("orange")
swap_plates("blue")
```

---

## Step 2
# Activity:

The Zombie Chef misplaced the order! Where could it have gone? Figure out which meal belongs to who! Then write a program to place the plates in front of the correct mob. 

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

swap_plates("orange")
swap_plates("blue")
swap_plates("yellow")
swap_plates("magenta")
```
