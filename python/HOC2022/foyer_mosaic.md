# Foyer Mosaic

## Step 1
# Picture Slide

It looks like these pieces are a part of an incomplete picture! Try reordering them to see what it's supposed to be! Use the `push_pieces()` function to trigger the pistons to move the pieces in that direction. 

The `push_pieces()` function takes one parameter, the direction you want to push the pieces.

Valid directions are:
- `up` ![Blue Up](img/chess_blue_up.png "Blue Up")
- `down` ![Red Down](img/chess_red_down.png "Red Down")
- `left` ![Yellow Left](img/chess_yellow_left.png "Yellow Left")
- `right` ![Green Right](img/chess_green_right.png "Green Right")

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the pieces in all
# 4 directions

push_pieces("left")
push_pieces("right")
push_pieces("down")
push_pieces("up")
```

## Step 2
# Activity:

Push the blocks to reorder them so all the different pieces make a complete picture!

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

push_pieces("left")
push_pieces("right")
push_pieces("down")
```
