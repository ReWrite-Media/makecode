# Study Move

## Step 1
# Clay Ball Maze

Move the clay ball to the gold block. Use the `clay_ball_move()` function to navigate the ball through the maze.

The `clay_ball_move()` function takes one parameter that defines what direction it should move in.

Valid directions are: 
- `up`
- `down`
- `left`
- `right`

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the clay ball up
# by 3 blocks

clay_ball_move("up")
clay_ball_move("up")
clay_ball_move("up")
```

---

## Step 2
# Pro Tip:

Use a `for` loop to do one or more actions multiple times.

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the clay ball up
# by 3 blocks

for i in range(3):
    clay_ball_move("up")
```

---

## Step 3
# Activity:

Navigate the clay ball through the maze to reach the gold block.

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
clay_ball_move("up")
clay_ball_move("up")
clay_ball_move("up")
clay_ball_move("left")
clay_ball_move("left")
clay_ball_move("down")
clay_ball_move("down")
clay_ball_move("down")
```
