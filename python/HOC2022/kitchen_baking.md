# Kitchen Baking

## Step 1
# Bake Bread

The Zombie Chef needs help making bread. Use the functions below to create a bread recipe the zombie chef can follow!

There are four functions available that represent the different steps in baking bread.
- `harvest_wheat()` ![Harvest Wheat](img/bread_wheat.png "Harvest Wheat")
- `bake_bread()` ![Bake Bread](img/bread_bake.png "Bake Bread")
- `make_dough()` ![Make Dough](img/bread_dough.png "Make Dough")
- `mill_wheat()` ![Mill Wheat](img/bread_mill.png "Mill Wheat")

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# example recipe

harvest_wheat()
make_dough()
bake_bread()
mill_wheat()
```

## Step 2
# Activity:

Chefs always keep a copy of their recipes around! I wonder where the Zombie Chef hid theirs? Figure out the correct steps, then program a recipe for the Zombie Chef to follow! 

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

harvest_wheat()
make_dough()
bake_bread()
mill_wheat()
```
