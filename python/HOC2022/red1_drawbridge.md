# Red1 Drawbridge

## Step 1
# Drawbridge

The Enderman Butler needs your direction to get across the river! Please direct them to use their magic to teleport to the diamond block, then have them move into position to pull the lever to let down the drawbridge! Use the `teleport_enderman_to_diamond()` function to get the Enderman across the river, then use `move_enderman_forward()` function to position the Enderman in front of the lever and `pull_lever_down()` to pull the lever. The Enderman Butler will automatically turn to face the lever when it's in the correct position!

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the enderman 2 blocks forward
# then teleport them to the diamond block

move_enderman_forward()
move_enderman_forward()
teleport_enderman_to_diamond()
```

---

## Step 2
# Actvitiy:

Teleport the Enderman over the river to flip the lever and bring down the drawbridge. Be careful not to let the Enderman fall into the water. They hate water!

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

move_enderman_forward()
move_enderman_forward()
teleport_enderman_to_diamond()
move_enderman_forward()
move_enderman_forward()
pull_lever_down()
```
