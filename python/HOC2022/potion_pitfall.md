# Potion Pitfall

## Step 1
# Pitfall

Woah, legs, no more rolling over for this golem! We need to help it safely navigate to the gold block. When the golem moves onto the pressure plate, the block it needs retracts for a moment. If we wait, it seems to come back! Use the `move_golem_forward()` function to move the golem and the `wait()` function to make it wait for the block to come back!

```python
# CODE EXAMPLE - YOU CAN NOT EDIT HERE
# RUN IT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

# move the golem forward 2 spaces
# wait one second and then move 
# 2 more spaces

move_golem_forward()
move_golem_forward()
wait()
move_golem_forward()
move_golem_forward()
```

---

## Step 2
# Activity:

Move the golem to the end without falling into the pit. Make sure to wait for the block to come back after the golem stands on a pressure plate.

The included code below is broken. Can you fix it? Run the code to see what happens, then debug it by editing it to the correct solution.

```python
# code here

move_golem_forward()
move_golem_forward()
wait()
move_golem_forward()
move_golem_forward()
move_golem_forward()
```
